# CMPS-104-COMPILER-DESIGN
An introduction to the basic techniques used in compiler design. Topics include compiler structure, symbol tables, regular expressions and languages, finite automata, lexical analysis, context-free languages, LL(1), recursive descent, LALR(1), and LR(1) parsing; and attribute grammars as a model of syntax-directed translation. Students use compiler building tools to construct a working compiler. Prerequisite(s): course 101 and Computer Engineering 12 and 12L. Teacher Wesley Mackey.
