This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Marian Vladoi (mvladoi@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Mikhail Lychagin (mlychagi@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Marian Vladoi    spent  _7_ hours working alone.
Mikhail Lychagin spent  _7_ hours working alone.
We               spent  _4_ hours working together.
Marian Vladoi    spent  _2_ hours driving.
Mikhail Lychagin spent  _2_ hours driving.

We tried to implemet the type checking but there
are cases that we could not cover and others shows errors where
there are none. If you comment the type_check_block in main.cpp
the rest of the errors are from parser.
